### [Why are Low-skilled Workers less Mobile? The Role of Mobility Costs and Spatial Frictions](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.15609/annaeconstat2009.142.0283#metadata_info_tab_contents) Annals of Economics and Statistics, 2021, 142, pp. 283-304

* **Abstract:** Workers’ propensity to migrate to another local labor market varies a lot by occupation. We use the model developed by Schmutz and Sidibé (2019) to quantify the impact of mobility costs and search frictions on this mobility gap. We estimate the
model on a matched employer-employee panel dataset describing labor market transitions within and between the 30 largest French cities for two groups at both ends
of the occupational spectrum and find that: (i) mobility costs are very comparable in
the two groups, so they are three times higher for blue-collar workers relative to their
respective expected income; (ii) Depending on employment status, spatial frictions
are between 2 and 3 times higher for blue-collar workers; (iii) Moving subsidies have
little (and possibly negative) impact on the mobility gap, contrary to policies targeting spatial frictions; (iv) Mobility-enhancing policies have almost no impact on the unemployment gap.

### [Commuting cost and Job-search]
##### Draft available upon request

  * **Abstract:** mong a series of environmental measures taken in 2008, the French government implemented 2009 the half-reimbursement by the employer of the public transport costs.
This paper aims to estimate the effect of a decrease in commuting costs on job search
behavior, using an administrative database with information on employment and un-
employment spell. I use an event-study design exploiting variation in the use of public
transport at the communal level. I find that a 10pp increase in the treatment intensity
increases the commuting distance by 3.2% and the hourly wage by 0.5%. The effect is
stronger for women and low-paid workers.

### What do women want in a job? Gender-biased preferences and the reservation wage gap 

##### Draft available upon request

  * **Abstract:** Recent explanations of the gender wage gap emphasize the role of gender differences in psychological traits. Nevertheless, there have been only a limited number of studies confirming the relevance of these factors for labour market outcomes. This paper assesses the role of gender specific preferences in the reservation wage gap during the job search. I use French administrative data from the unemployment insurance agency providing information on job search behaviour and previous outcomes to assess which kind of occupations men and women apply for and the gap in their reservation wages. Employing text analysis, I build a novel dataset classifying occupations with respect to a number of characteristics and examine to which extent men and women differ in the occupation they are looking for.  I document widespread gender differences in the occupation characteristics targeted by job seekers. Quantile decomposition methods allow me to document an unequal gap in reservation wage, intensifying along the distribution. After adjusting for occupation characteristics reflecting gender-biased preferences and household constraints, the unexplained part of the reservation wage gap is decreased by half. Investigating unemployment history and outcomes from previous interviews with firms, I do not find evidence of a female risk aversion to previous unemployment shocks or male overconfidence.
