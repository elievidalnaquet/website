### [Why are Low-skilled Workers less Mobile? The Role of Mobility Costs and Spatial Frictions](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.15609/annaeconstat2009.142.0283#metadata_info_tab_contents)
* **Abstract:** Workers’ propensity to migrate to another local labor market varies a lot by occupation. We use the model developed by Schmutz and Sidibé (2019) to quantify the impact of mobility costs and search frictions on this mobility gap. We estimate the
model on a matched employer-employee panel dataset describing labor market transitions within and between the 30 largest French cities for two groups at both ends
of the occupational spectrum and find that: (i) mobility costs are very comparable in
the two groups, so they are three times higher for blue-collar workers relative to their
respective expected income; (ii) Depending on employment status, spatial frictions
are between 2 and 3 times higher for blue-collar workers; (iii) Moving subsidies have
little (and possibly negative) impact on the mobility gap, contrary to policies targeting spatial frictions; (iv) Mobility-enhancing policies have almost no impact on the
unemployment gap.

### [The multiple dimensions of selection into employment](https://www.amse-aixmarseille.fr/sites/default/files/working_papers/wp_2022_-_nr_19.pdf)

##### Revise and Resubmit at Labour Economics  

  * **Abstract:** A vast literature on gender wage gaps has examined the importance of selection into employment. However, most analyses have focused only on female labour force participation and gaps at the median. The Great Recession questions this approach both because of the major shift in male employment that it implied but also because women’s decisions to participate seem to have been different along the distribution, particularly due to an “added worker effect”. This paper uses the methodology proposed by Arellano and Bonhomme (2017) to estimate a quantile selection model over the period 2007-2018. Using a tax and benefit mi- crosimulation model, I compute an instrument capturing the male selection induced by the crisis as well as female decisions: the potential out-of-work income. Since my instrument is crucially determined by the welfare state, I consider three countries with notably different benefit systems – the UK, France and Finland. My results imply different selection patterns across countries and a sizeable male selection in France and the UK. Correction for selection bias lowers the gender wage gap and, in most recent years, reveals an increasing shape of gender gap distribution with a substantial glass ceiling for the three countries.

### What do women want in a job? Gender-biased preferences and the reservation wage gap 

##### Draft available upon request

  * **Abstract:** Recent explanations of the gender wage gap emphasize the role of gender differences in psychological traits. Nevertheless, there have been only a limited number of studies confirming the relevance of these factors for labour market outcomes. This paper assesses the role of gender specific preferences in the reservation wage gap during the job search. I use French administrative data from the unemployment insurance agency providing information on job search behaviour and previous outcomes to assess which kind of occupations men and women apply for and the gap in their reservation wages. Employing text analysis, I build a novel dataset classifying occupations with respect to a number of characteristics and examine to which extent men and women differ in the occupation they are looking for.  I document widespread gender differences in the occupation characteristics targeted by job seekers. Quantile decomposition methods allow me to document an unequal gap in reservation wage, intensifying along the distribution. After adjusting for occupation characteristics reflecting gender-biased preferences and household constraints, the unexplained part of the reservation wage gap is decreased by half. Investigating unemployment history and outcomes from previous interviews with firms, I do not find evidence of a female risk aversion to previous unemployment shocks or male overconfidence.
